#  Day 1: Introduction to Verilog RTL Design & Synthesis

Welcome to **Day 1** of the RTL Workshop!  
Today, you'll embark on your journey into digital design by learning Verilog, open-source simulation with **Icarus Verilog (iverilog)**, and the basics of logic synthesis using **Yosys**. This guide will walk you through practical labs, essential concepts, and insightful explanations to help you build a strong foundation in RTL design.

## 1. What is a Simulator, Design, and Testbench?

###  Simulator

A **simulator** is a software tool that checks your digital circuit’s functionality by applying test inputs and viewing outputs. This helps you verify your design before hardware implementation.

###  Design

The **design** is your Verilog code describing the intended logic functionality.

###  Testbench

A **testbench** is a simulation environment that applies various inputs to your design and checks if the outputs are correct.

## 2. Getting Started with iverilog

**iverilog** is an open-source simulator for Verilog. Here’s the typical simulation flow:

- Both the design and testbench are provided as input to iverilog.
- The simulator produces a `.vcd` file for waveform viewing in GTKWave.

## 3. Lab: Simulating a 2-to-1 Multiplexer

Let’s simulate a simple **2-to-1 multiplexer** using iverilog!

###  Step 1: Clone the Workshop Repository

```shell
git clone https://github.com/kunalg123/sky130RTLDesignAndSynthesisWorkshop.git
cd sky130RTLDesignAndSynthesisWorkshop/verilog_files
```

###  Step 2: Install Required Tools

```shell
sudo apt install iverilog
sudo apt install gtkwave
```

###  Step 3: Simulate the Design

Compile the design and testbench:

```shell
iverilog good_mux.v tb_good_mux.v
```

Run the simulation:

```shell
./a.out
```

View the waveform:

```shell
gtkwave tb_good_mux.vcd
```
